# Uyghur-inequity-in-Chinese-borders
Effectively illustrates the nature of the subject of inequity with the treatment of Uyghur minority peoples in the geopolitical country of China by its government, focused in the region called East Turkistan/Turkestan by its Uyghur peoples and which is also known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China by the government and much of the outside world simply as Xinjiang. Attempt to do so in a way which lets data tell the story, and without adding political or ideological rhetoric.
